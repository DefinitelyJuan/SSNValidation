### Project information
This project consists of a basic Python app that allows the user to enter a string. The program will validate if this string fulfills the following conditions, in order to tell if it is a valid Social Security Number (SSN).

You should have **Python 3.7.8 or another compatible version before using the app**. If you need more information on how to install Python, please refer to the User Manual's **Before Starting** section, which you can open using the link included on the **File locations** section of this document.
