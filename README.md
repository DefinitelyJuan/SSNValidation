### Project information
This project consists of a basic Python app that allows the user to enter a string. The program will validate if this string fulfills the following conditions, in order to tell if it is a valid Social Security Number (SSN). The conditions for a valid SSN are listed below: 
1. It should have 9 digits.
2. It should be divided into 3 parts by hyphen (-).
    1. The first part should have 3 digits and should not be 000, 666, or between 900 and 999.
    2. The second part should have 2 digits and it should be from 01 to 99.
    3. The third part should have 4 digits and it should be from 0001 to 9999. 

You should have **Python 3.7.8 or another compatible version before using the app**. If you need more information on how to install Python, please refer to the User Manual's **Before Starting** section, which you can open using the link included on the **File locations** section of this document.
